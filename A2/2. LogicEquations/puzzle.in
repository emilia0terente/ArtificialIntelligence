%You have to figure out the variables' values by solving the logic equations below.

set(arithmetic).
assign(max_models, -1).
assign(domain_size, 5).

list (distinct).
   [0, A, B, C, D].
end_of_list.

formulas(assumptions).
  2*D > 4.
  A + D != 5.
  B*D < 10.
  C*D < 10.
  B + D != 4.
  C*D < 6.
  A > C + 2.
end_of_list.
