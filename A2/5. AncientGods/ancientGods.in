%There are four Greek gods in this logic problem. 
%You have to associate them with their respective Roman gods, weekday and domain.
%1. Aphrodite and Ares are not Mercury.
%2. Zeus was worshipped the day after Hermes and the day before Venus.
%3. Ares' domain is either War or he is known as Jupiter. 
%4. The god of poetry is either Aphrodite or worshipped on Wednesday.
%5. Friday and Tuesday are not good days for poetry.
%6. Jupiter's day is two days after the god of War's day.
%7. Mercury is worshipped the day before the god of Thunder.
