In A1 I have implemented search algorithms for Pac-Man game: A, A* Weighted, Dijkstra, Incremental Heuristic Search and Heuristic for Corner Problem. Here are present only the search.py and searchAgent.py files from the Pac-Man projects developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course. http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html
In A2 are files with code for logic puzzles taken form Branzilla (https://www.brainzilla.com/). The code is written in Mace4 and Prover9 logic.
